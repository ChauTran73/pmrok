# The Chingu Project Management Repository of Knowledge



## PMRok Site Features


### Wiki

A GitHub wiki has been set up in this repo to act as a file cabinet for the
information we wish to retain over time. This is intended to be something
Chingu PM's can contribute to to promote continuous improvement as well as to
share what we've learned with our fellow PM's.

### Projects

We will be using GitHub Projects to track both current events and dates (like
Voyages) and also for planning and tracking any PM-specific projects we might
undertake.
