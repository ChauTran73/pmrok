# The Chingu Project Management Repository of Knowledge

## Purpose

The Chingu Project Management Repository of Knowledge is a place for Chingu
project managers to share information and lessons learned with one another.
While no one project management methodology is used within the Chingu
organization the ones used are all rooted in and Agile and Lean way of directing 
and performing project work.

The information included he is free for you to share inside and outside your
teams. However, as a Chingu PM you have the responsibility of helping this
site grow and mature by:

- Ensuring that the information here is accurate. You are expected to either
open an Issue for any errors or inconsistencies you find or in the spirit of
Agile development fix it yourself.
- Collaborating with your fellow PM's to identify areas of our project
management practices and processes that need improvement and creating the
content needed to fill any gaps.
- Questioning the status quo. We should drive continuous improvement by
reflecting on what we do, finding faster and better ways to manage our
projects, and being open to new ways of doing things.

## What is a PM?

An Agile PM is responsible for managing the resouces, time, and scope that
make up a project to ensure that a quality product is delivered within the
desired schedule and budget. A Chingu PM doesn't just coordinate the project. 
She also acts as a member of the development team writing code, testing the
app, and creating documentation.

An important difference between a PM in a corporate setting and yourselves is
that since we are operating in a volunteer environment just like every Open
Source project you are also a coach, a motivator, and a role model. We can't
order our team mates we must establish and environment that motivates them to
be both innovative and productive.

In your role as a Chingu Project Managerâ€™ your most important two tasks are to
understand your teams needs and to remove any obstacles blocking their progress.
This requires a large amount of communication and a deep understanding of what
resources, including people, are available in the Chingu organization.

## PMRok Site Features

### Issues & Questions

Issues and questions should be logged in the [PMRoK Issue Log](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/pmrok/issues). This is important to ensure
that issues and questions are addressed in a timely manner and so serve as
both an ongoing reference as well as a historical record.

For information about how to open an issue see
[Issue Reporting & Tracking](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/pmrok/wiki/Issue-Reporting-and-Tracking) in
our GitHub wiki.

### Wiki

A GitHub wiki as been set up in this repo to act as a file cabinet for the
information we wish to retain over time. This is intended to be something
Chingu PM's can contribute to to promote continuous improvement as well as to
share what we've learned with our fellow PM's.

### Projects

We will be using GitHub Projects to track both current events and dates (like
Voyages) and also for planning and tracking any PM-specific projects we might
undertake.

### Tools

Planning a project, managing scope, tracking progress, and performing periodic
adjustments to compensate for change requires constant communication with your
team and effective management of the project backlog. Perfoming these activities
is time consuming and can be tedious. Luckily, there are many tools available 
that can help you focus on the results rather than just the steps.

Since the problems you face fall into several categories:

#### Meeting Planning

Scheduling meetings in an organization like the Chingus is complicated by the
fact our team mates are spread across many continents and timezones. Coupled
with team mate obligations outside of the Chingu universe this makes finding
meeting times suitable for all team members as difficult as trying to nail
jello to a tree.

A few tools that can help determine optimal meeting times are:

- [World Clock Meeting Planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html)

- [Timezone](http://timezone.me/en/meeting-planner)

#### Project Management

#### Issue Tracking

Keeping track of the issues to ensure that they are quickly and permanently
resolved plays a major role in improving product quality and lowering technical
debt. The rigor your team shows in how they deal with issue reporting reflects
their maturity as both a team and in their chosen profession as WebDevs.

Some tools that can be used to introduce the necessary rigor to issue tracking
include:

- [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
